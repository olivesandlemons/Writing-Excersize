            <p>
                
            Her eyes are blue, <br>
            Your eyes are brown, <br>
            Hers represent the ocean, <br>
            Yours represents the ground, <br>
            You've always hated your eyes, <br>
            And wished that they were blue, <br>
            But your eyes have a tint of gold, <br>
            So rare that it must not be true, <br>
            So yes her eyes are blue, <br>
            And yes your eyes are brown, <br>
            But your eyes hold the riches, <br> 
            That are buried in the ground, <br>
            Her eyes carry storms, <br>
            And rage like the sea, <br>
            Your eyes carry earthquakes, <br> 
            That bring mountains to their knees, <br>
            Maybe her eyes are blue, <br>
            But your eyes reign queen, <br>
            Because they hold the purest riches, <br>
                That the world has ever seen. <br> </p>

           <p>
                You hated your eye color, <br> 
                
                Called it a dull and dirty brown, <br>
                Wished for the deep blue of an ocean, <br> 
                Where admirers hearts would drown, <br>
                And it pained me when l realized, <br>
                That you'd never see it like l do, <br>
                The way your eyes hint at a story, <br>
                That l want to read right through, <br>
                They hold specks of stolen sunlight, <br>
                That you/d miss with just one glance, <br>
                And a depth of raw emotion, <br>
                That could freeze you in a trance, <br>
                They're a fix of melted chocolate, <br>
                When l'm craving something sweet, <br>
                But hold a gaze that's so unwavering, <br>
                That l find it hard to meet, <br>
                I fall right down the rabbit hole, <br>
                When l look into your eyes, <br>
                The brown of earth's unfettered beauty, <br>
                That l yearn to memorise, <br>
                When l was tired of not knowing, <br>
                They made me feel like l'd been found, <br>
                And l hope you never say again, <br>
                That your eyes are simply brown. <br> </p>

                Dear Brown Eyes, <br>
                Where do l begin?
                You think you're not beautiful, <br>
                And to have you is like a sin, <br>
                You're brought up thinking you're boring, <br>
                Comparede to blue, grey, and green, <br>
                No one seems to notice you, <br>
                And now you've got low self esteem, <br>
                You compare yourself to others, <br>
                Wonder why you always get looked by, <br>
                Which makes you hate yourself even more, <br>
                And this is where you try not to cry, <br>
                I'm going to be honest with you, <br>
                They won't understand how you really feel, <br>
                I mean they'll tell you, "You're beautiful, now shut up," <br>
                But how on earth is that supposed to make you heal? <br>
                Don't get me wrong, it'll happen, <br>
                Someone will finally understand your cries, <br>
                But that day is not today, <br>
                Sincerely, Brown Eyes.

            She's just as fresh, as the morning dew,<br>
            Her brown eyes sparkle bright.<br>
            Like the paint on a car, that's still brand new, <br>
            Such a warm and tender light.<br><br>
            Like dew that sparkles, on leaves of green,<br>
            When struck by the morning sun.<br>
            Fresh, and birght, and new, and clean,<br>
            Every new day, that's begun.<br><br><br><br><br>
            That's the way, her brown eyes shine,<br>
            Everytime l see her face.<br>
            Those big brown eyes are just divine, <br>
            They gaze upon me with such grace.

            We always hear about<br>
            the people with blue eyes<br>
            In every love song<br>
            Compared to the deep blue sea<br>
            But what we don't hear baout as much<br>
            Is the people with Brown Eyes<br>
            You may think they are ugly<br>
            The color of dirt<br>
            Bt what you don't realize is<br>
            They are beautiful<br>
            The color of chocolate and coffee<br>
            All the things that people love are brown<br>
            When l look into someone's brown eyes<br>
            I get a sweet sensation<br>
            I have brown eyes<br>
            I have always hated them<br>
            But then l realized<br>
            I have brown eyes<br>
            And l wouldn't trade<br>
            Them for anything<br>
            EVER<br>
            Because l love my brown eyes<br>

                  Yes, her eyes are blue. Yes, every love song is about them. Every poem compares them to the sea. <br>
                  But you, you have eyes of amber and onyx. Your eyes are the gold that people desperately try to pull from the ground. Her eyes may hold the depth of an ocean, but your eyes hold the magnitude of a black hole. <br>
                  Your eyes carry a weight too heavy for even the ocean to sweep away in it's abyss. Your eyes are anything but ordinary. <br> <br></p>

                  <p>It blows my mind that after all this time  you've spent on this earth, nobody ever bothered to tell you that your eyes aren't fucking brown. <br>
                  They are copper against honey and sage and when they water they glow, to perfect orbs the same shade as nature after it rains. <br> <br> 
                  You're not as simple as they want you to be. <br><br></p>

                  Sometimes when the light shines on them they turn gold and glimmer. <br><br>
                  Some brown eyes have flecks of black or deeper browns. <br><br>
                  Some brown eyes are smooth, just one, constant, dark brown. Like stone. <br><br>
                    Brown eyes are beautiful. <br><br></p>

                   <p> Brown eyes are beautiful. <br>
                    Brown eyes are dark, rich, and decadent; They remind me of freshly turned earth after rain. Sometimes they're so dark they become inky, almost black, full of depths you can't begin to fathom. When sunlight hits them suddenly they are brilliant and clear, like perfectly worn sea glass or water in a stream running over driftwood and stones. <br> <br>
                    Brown eyes are beautiful.<br> <br><br> </p>

                    Have you ever seen brown eyes in the sun? You don't always notice it but you'll see that 'brown' no longer describes them. They melt into golden rays, circling an eclipse. There's nothing boring about brown eyes, not even when the later hours encroach; they just tur into a sunset of their own.<br><br></p>
